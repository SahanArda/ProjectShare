- **`PORT`:** Specify the port on which the server will run. Default is 3000.
- **`MONGODB_URI`:** The URI for connecting to your MongoDB database.
- **`JWT_TOKEN`:** Used for securing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) in your authentication system. It should be a secret key shared between your server and the authentication provider to sign and verify JWTs.

You can create a `.env` file in the project root and define these variables there. Make sure not to commit your `.env` file to version control.

```env
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
JWT_TOKEN=value
